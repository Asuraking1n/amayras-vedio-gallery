There are many great video Galleries ; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a Gallery on fashion it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on only something you really need. A project that solves a problem and helps others.
* You shouldn't be search again and again for same type of video.

Of course, no one Video Library will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more videos in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have reviewed to expanding this CL!
